/**
 * Chat governance — the meaning checks.
 *
 * A judge model reads a message or a reply against the creator's rulebook
 * and answers in JSON. The judge is a separate call from the chatbot: it
 * never sees the chatbot's instructions, and the text it reads is passed as
 * data, not instructions.
 *
 * Anything other than a well-formed answer (an error, a refusal, malformed
 * JSON, an unknown moment id) throws JudgeUnavailableError. The pipeline
 * treats that as "couldn't check" and sends nothing unchecked.
